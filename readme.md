# Vermont Covid-19 Charts

These Jupyter notebooks provide some alternatives to the official state-provided reporting, but are based on official state data.

**Note:** Vermont stopped updating Covid-19 case reporting on 09/21/2022. This project remains online for historical interest.

* VT-Covid-19-ByCounty.ipynb - county-by-county test and hospitalization data
* VT-Covid-19-Data-Pandas.ipynb - full-state data including tests, hospitalizations, and deaths

VT-Covid-19-Data-Pandas.ipynb includes commentary about how I set up the notebooks to read and process the data as provided by the state. It also includes some tips on aspects of formatting charts.
